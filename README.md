Little R is currently a bot for my guild only.

**Just for your notice Little R is NO WHERE near to be completed and I work on the bot when I have time.**

## NOTICE
This repository will be deleted once I get another hosting system up and running.
As of now this repository is the main botfile setting place.

In the dear future I will probally expand it to make it a bot for everyone to download and use.
You can try to use the bot right now, but it's whitelist only. I'd still give you the link to add it though.

But if you would like to come and look at the bot in function on my guild! Come and join!
